# Savannah Informatics Back End Dev - Technical Challenge

## About The Project
The project is a simple customer order technical challenge question, integrating SMS alerting as well as authorization and authentication using OpenID Connect(AUTH0).

The technical interview was built around a coding assignment that is designed to screen for the following basic skills:
* Experience in developing REST and GraphQL APIs in Python/Go
* Experience with a configuration management tool e.g. Chef, Puppet, Ansible etc
* Experience working with an infrastructure as code tool e.g. Terraform or Pulumi
will be an advantage.
* Experience working with containers and container orchestration tools e.g. k8s
* Experience writing automated tests at all levels - unit, integration and acceptance testing
* Experience with CI/CD (any CI/CD platform)

Particularly the areas of interest include:
* Testing + coverage + CI/CD
* HTTP and APIs e.g. REST
* OAuth2
* Web security e.g. XSS
* Logic / flow of thought
* Setting up a database
* Version control

## Screening Test
1. Create a simple Python or Go service.
2. Design a simple customers and orders database (keep it simple)
3. Add a REST or GraphQL API to input / upload customers and orders:
    - Customers have simple details e.g., name and code.
    - Orders have simple details e.g., item, amount, and time.
4. Implement authentication and authorization via OpenID Connect
5. When an order is added, send the customer an SMS alerting them (you can use the
Africaâ€™s Talking SMS gateway and sandbox)
6. Write unit tests (with coverage checking) and set up CI + automated CD. You can deploy
to any PAAS/FAAS/IAAS of your choice
7. Write a README for the project and host it on your GitHub

## Getting Started

For the technical challenge, I decided to develop the project using Flask because of its simplicity and flexibility, since the the project does not have alot of requirements and MySQL as my database for the project.

#### Functionalities of the project:
* Creating a customer
* Creating an order
* Storing the created orders and customers
* Authentication and Authorization via OpenID Connect
* SMS Alerting using Africa's Talking SMS gateway and sandbox

## Environment
This project is interpreted/tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Flask (version 3.0.3)

I created .env file and add the following contents serving as credentials.

```
# yoursecret key
SECRET_KEY=" "

# Database configurations
DB_USERNAME="flask_user"
DB_PASSWORD=" "
DB_HOST="localhost"
DB_NAME="customer_order"

# oidc Auth0 credentials
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID="leAT0LwGQ8bY8fCT8Qj81HYTQcUEanwA"
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=" "
AUTH0_DOMAIN="dev-7fg7hphj1ldi61w0.us.auth0.com"
AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL="http://localhost:5000/callback"

# Africa's talking portal credentials
AT_USERNAME="sandbox"
AT_API_KEY=" "
``` 
You can use your values according to your preference

## Installation
* To get started, install python3 development tools on your virtual machine.
* `sudo apt-get update`
* `sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev libpq-dev postgresql postgresql-contrib`
* Setup postgre database: `sudo -u postgres psql` (Create database, create user and grant all priviledges, alter encoding and timezone role)
* Install virtual environment and install django
* `sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade pip` then `sudo -H pip3 install virtualenv`
* Create directory and install django 
* `mkdir project_portfolio && cd project_portfolio`
* `virtualenv bitinvoiceenv`
* `source bitinvoiceenv/bin/activate`
* Install packages: `pip install django` and `pip install psycopg2`
* Create a new django project called bitinvoice: `django-admin startproject bitinvoice`
* `cd bitinvoice` and edit settings file with Database details
* Run django app: `python manage.py makemigrations` then `python manage.py migrate`
* Create a superuser: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
* Collect static: `python manage.py collectstatic`
* Run app: `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:5000`
* Start the app bitinvoice: `python manage.py startapp bitinvoice_01`

## File Descriptions
[app.py](app.py) - This are the base models or entry point to the project.
#### models - included are the base classes used for this project
Classes in the model:
#### `Customer` - This is the class containing the customers information
* Basic Fields defined
	* `id` - Primary key
 	* `code` - Unique code for every customer
	* `name` - Customer name
	* `phone_number` - customer phone number
* `def before_insert(mapper, connection, target)` - Static method ensuring code is generated if not set manually

#### `Order` - This is the class containing the order information
* Basic fields, utility fields and related field(client foreign key)
	* `id` - Primary key
	* `customer_id` - Foreign key
	* `item` - Ordered item
	* `amount` - Amount of the item

#### Routes - Routes used by the APIs and Auth0
Such routes used include:

#### `/login` - Auth0 login route
* Returns redirect to callback url

#### `/callback` - Callback after login to Auth0
* Returns user information in JSON format

#### `/protected` - Routing for protected view
* Protected user session after login

#### `/logout` - Logout routing from Auth0
* Redirects to login page after seccessfully logging out

#### `/add_customer` - API for creating a customer
